# Traffic-System
This was my assignment for Object Oriented Programming in C++ during my second semester. The problem statement was 

**"Develop a small traffic management system. Which has 3 lights and 4 sides to manage traffic. North, south east west are the sides and red, orange, green are the lights. You may add timer to each signal light for better understanding of the traffic. Your task is develop a small system that will control the flow of the traffic. Both lights and sides should be parent classes. And all other classes should be derived classes from these parent classes. Methods and data members can be belonged to both parent and derived classes. Any parent class can also be an abstract base class. Methods like turnSignal(),signalTime(), sideWaiting(), sideReady(), sideMoving() should be implemented using the concept of inheritance, polymorphisam. Variables like lightcolor, sideName, time etc should be used. These methods and variables are just to make concept clear and are not necessary at all.
You have to utilize your own skills and should develop understanding level to real time problem.
You must implement all concepts like classes with inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and dynamic casting. 
Again, it is not necessary to implement above given scenario as it is. You are a smart student you must develop a good program that is best of your understanding and imagination.**

I was really tired and due to procastination I made this one hour before my submission deadline. So just ignore the sloppy coding.
